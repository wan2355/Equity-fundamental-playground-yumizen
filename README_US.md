# Equity-fundamental-playground-kana
A formula-first, structure-oriented playground for equity fundamental analysis.
(Not for trading signals.)

This repository provides scripts and outputs for
**fundamental data visualization and structural comparison of companies**.

The goal is **not stock selection**, but understanding
how different companies are built and evaluated by the market.

---

## What This Project Does

- Normalizes key fundamental metrics
- Visualizes ratios such as:
  - FCF/Rev
  - CapEx/Rev
  - MC/Rev
  - MC/FCF
- Generates summary tables based on structural axes:
  - CYCLE
  - SW (Software-like)
  - HW (Hardware-like)

---

## What This Project Does NOT Do

- It does NOT generate buy/sell signals
- It does NOT predict stock prices
- It does NOT provide investment recommendations

All outputs are for **educational and analytical purposes only**.

## Example Interpretation (Conceptual)

Consider a company with the following characteristics:

- High SW score
- Moderate CYCLE score
- Very high MC/Rev and MC/FCF
- PEG-like ratio significantly above peers

A naive interpretation might be:
> “This company is overvalued.”

A more appropriate interpretation is:
> “The market is pricing in long-term optionality,
> while current growth or cash flow has not yet caught up.”

This does **not** imply:
- that the stock should be avoided
- that the valuation is wrong

It simply highlights a **structural mismatch in timing** between
business fundamentals and market expectations.

Such cases require:
- patience
- scenario-based thinking
- and careful position sizing

rather than immediate valuation judgment.
